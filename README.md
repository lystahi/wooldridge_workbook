Python solutions to computer exercises in Wooldridge 5e

Notebook assumes that the data sets for Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 5th Edition are contained in a folder called stata and excel (Excel data sets are for the cases where Stata data sets don't import properly)

Data is available at the book's companion website: https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041

Solutions take the format of work on a given problem appearing in cells first (usually denoted with a comment) with written solutions appearing in markdown at the end. There is little exposition in these notebooks and they cannot be read without reference to the textbook.

These solutions should not be considered a substitution for working through the problems, though they may be helpful in showing alternative approachs to those coming from other programs. Comments, especially with regards to fixing errors, are welcome.
